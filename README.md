# THESIS-CODE
 A research using the CICMalmem 2022 dataset focusing on the multi class classification of malware. The dataset have first been preprocessed and visualised to give an overview and understanding of any outliears and missing values needed to be taken care of, and then split into train test. The training data is then used to train basic meachine learning models and then an ensemble is created that takes all the outputs from the ML models and gives an accuracy using majorityVoting classifier. To check the perfermance of the model, ROC AUC (roc_auc_ovr) is calculated that is crucial for multi class classification, showing how well the model distinguishes between multiple classes.
